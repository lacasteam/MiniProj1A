						Sorsogon Festivals and Events
					</h2>
					<p>Sorsogon, like most provinces in the Philippines, have its own customs and traditions that are influenced by the
						nearby provinces. Many of the Sorsogon festivals and events are offshoots of Christian religious traditions and are
						given a local distinct variation.</p>

        <h3>Kasanggayahan Festival</h3>
        <p>
          The Kasanggayahan Festival, perhaps, is the largest celebration for the whole province of Sorsogon.
          Celebrated during the month of October every year, this festival is the commemoration of the declaration of
          Sorsogon as a province. Before Sorsogon became a province in the Bicol region, it used to be part of Albay,
          which is another province in the region.
        </p>
        <p>
          This festival is included in the Department of Tourism’s list of festivals and celebrations in the
          Philippines. With the term “kasanggayahan” meaning prosperity, the festival showcases the local products
          including products from the pili tree and other agricultural products.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Pantomina sa Tinampo is one of the features of the Kasanggayahan Festival that makes it different from
          the other thanksgiving festivals in the country. Pantomina sa Tinampo is a native regional dance, which is
          the dance of the doves. This pantomime (pantomina) dance of love and courtship is done on the streets
          (tinampo), because of which it was termed “Pantomina sa Tinampo.”

        <h3>Pili Festival</h3>
        <p>
          Because pili products are bountiful in Sorsogon and in the rest of the Bicol region, it is easy to
          understand that the people of Sorsogon have devoted a festival that features this valuable nut. The Pili
          Festival is held every June 28-29, which are also the feast days of their patrons St. Peter and St. Paul.
        </p>
        <p>
          Different dance groups composed of young men and women follows the beats of the percussion instruments as
          they show the different products that are made from the pili tree. These groups certainly prepares for this
          celebration as they have appropriate costumes and props to make their presentation more appealing, relevant
          and lively.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most well known pili product is its nut, which is known to compete with macadamia nuts and almonds in
          terms of quality and distinct taste.

        <h3>Holy Week Celebration</h3>
        <p>
          In addition to Christmas and the New Year, the commemoration of the Passion of Jesus Christ is also one of
          the most anticipated celebrations in the country. Although Christianity was brought to the Philippines by
          the Spanish colonizers, the Filipinos were able to make the Holy Week Celebration a local tradition through
          the incorporation of native practices and materials.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Sorsogon, the locals come to the Cathedral of St. Peter and Saint Paul from which they start a barefoot
          procession as they take the statue of Jesus to the crucifixion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Apart from these festivals, each municipality and town in Sorsogon celebrates their fiestas depending on the
          feast days of their patron saints. This is another way to showcase the culture and the products of the place
          and to thank God for their blessings.
